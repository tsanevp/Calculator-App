## Overview

### The challenge

- Creating a mini-game utilizing JS and JQuery with little prior experience with either:
    - It was a great learning opportunity to challenge myself to make a small game using JQuery. Now, I have a much deeper understanding of how to traverse and manipulate my HTML documents effectively
- Scanning the JQuery documentation
- Keeping my code readable and easy to understand

## My process

### Built with
#### FrontEnd
- HTML5
- CSS
- JS
#### Backend
- Node.js
- Express

### What I learned

- How to use JQuery to implement JS in my simple game
- How to apply async and await keywords to enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior in my code

### Continued development

- [ ]  Add high-score tracker
- [ ]  Add a score leaderboard so you can compete with your friends
- [ ]  Improve the UX design of the game to look better. Very minimal at the moment

### Useful resources

- [JQuery documentation](https://api.jquery.com/) - Was constantly referring to documentation
